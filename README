HW 1
Comp 15
To complie: "make char"
To run: "./char"
Acknowledgments: The lecture slides on copy constructors and assignment
constructors, and my friend Tyler for listening to me complain. Also,
I reused many concepts from Lab 1.
Purpose: To create an array list that holds char elements.
Files submitted:
- README: this file
- Makefile
- testCharArrayList.cpp: Driver file which uses their functions
- CharArrayList.cpp: Holds each CharArrayList function
- CharArrayList.h: defines CharArrayList class and the scope of each function
Testing:
I began by creating the header file and defining the first constructor,
which I then created an instance of. After that compiled, I added a print
function, and my first push function, then tested printing the array
after things were added. Next I added the clear and isEmpty functions, and
checked that both worked as expected. I then added concatenation
and checked that running it with an input of the test array would work.
Once it was concatenated, I tested replacing the 1st element. I then removed
the 0th element and printed it again. I then added testing to see if the size
function was accurate directly after a print statement so they could be
compared, then I tested the third constructor. With the newly created test
array, I checked the first and last functions as well as the assignment
operator. I then tested poping and pushing and made a third test array
using the copy constructor. My final test array was created from a single
element, and I used it to test insertion in order and accessing an index.
Structures:
ArrayList, a dynamic array which allows for adding/removing elements by copying
the array's contents into a placeholder which is then copied back into
the same memory location but with more space allocated.
